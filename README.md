The first [Puyo Puyo](https://puyonexus.com/wiki/Puyo_Puyo_(1991)) has been originally released on MSX2, Famicom Disk System and later on Famicom (the Japanese NES).
[Puyo Puyo Tsu](https://puyonexus.com/wiki/Puyo_Puyo_Tsu) which introduced the game mechanics that are still used in today in competition, has never been ported to the Nintendo 8bit console despite having been ported on several 8bit hardware such as the Game Boy and the Game Gear, preventing fans of the game and the NES to enjoy the most enjoyable rules for 1v1 on their favorite console.
This game is my attempt to offer that game experience to every puyo and NES lover :-)

Puyo VNES has been tested on real hardware (PAL NES and NTSC NES) with an everdrive N8 and custom cartridges. It should run fine a Famicom too.
It has also been tested on Megadrive with a Mega Everdrive.
It is a NROM (Mapper 0) game so technically could have been done in 1983 and should be easy to emulate.

I recommend using [MESEN](https://mesen.ca/) by Sour for the most accurate experience, it has also been extensively used for debugging and performance profiling.
The game has been developped enterily with [8bitworkshop](https://8bitworkshop.com/) by Steven Hugg and its associated tool.
The voice sample has been converted using [DMCConv](http://nesdev.org/dmcconv005.zip) by Norix.
I would like to thanks the authors of these tools and the nesdev community for making NES development accessible to everyone.
